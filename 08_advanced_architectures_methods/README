I want to apply AI to languages. To be able to predict and create new words from the English language in a point in time for example the ELizabethan era and see if 
AI knows how the language can involved. I would use Corpuses of English words probably old English from the time period. I think I will use GAN for this and the metric used
for success is the true positives/false negative. If there is a high success, the machine can perhaps predict if words are borrowed in other languages. This can help
language learners understand.
